# Coursera Assignment - Predicting the Next Word

This is one of the Coursera assignments provided in the Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow course in the week 4 section where it discusses Sequence models and literature. This assignment is about creating a model that will predict the next word in a text sequence, by taking a corpus of Shakespeare sonnets and using them to train a model. Then, see if that model can create poetry.
